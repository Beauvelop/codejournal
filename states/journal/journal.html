  I'm concerned that in the months and years(?) to come tht this JS curriculum be delivered to an audience of adequate maturity and experience in coding. --Otherwise it will be a bore. At any rate. I've got a proof of concept design and plan to build it in React using styled components #FTW.</h3>

  The pen is <a target="_blank" href="https://codepen.io/beau_dev/full/RgRwNm/">here.</a> It's adequate. Skew() is still a bit of a mystery. translate3d() works out the gpu & for the larger painting project, I'm going to run into performance issues when I begin to animate. <br>
  <br />
  Besides, (as per simply loading the thing when I'm done) TTFP is gonna suck if I don't figure it out. I've always heard that animating box-shadow is absolutely <em>browser-paint</em> cray-cray. --Not something I can ignore.

  Will have to confront something else I've been ignoring: CSS Shapes. Either render this puppy in svg or go pure css for all of it. Oy vey...
  Okay. today I'm into grid areas and naming lines. It doesn't look easy. Perceived blocks are appropriating relative units to the project I'm working on. I may go purely with px. --So long as containers are using px, I'll be okay I think. (houses, window-containers, etc.).</h3>

  <br />A dev-ops guy once advised me, "Concentrate on one thing. A small schema...just a couple of tables. Hook up those endpoints and hit them from the front-end. Keep it small." It was good advice.
  All my life I've been fighting this appetite to learn all the things vs focus on one thing... At this point, I have no time to speculate which approach is better.<br /><br>

  I just have to believe that cycling through, methodically, a list of tech--each, more or less--working in concert with the others--will deepen my grasp of each individually and the ecosystem as a whole. <br /><br />The joy in the immediate process is confirmed.
