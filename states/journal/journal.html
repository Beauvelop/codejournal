  <h3 class="subtitle">Exhausted but I'm still in the game. Cannot stop thinking of this codedrops demo <a href="https://tympanus.net/Development/FolderPreviewIdeas/" target="_blank">and how I'd make it differently.</a> It kind of haunts me. <br>
  Ok, onward and upward. I've completed the runthrough of GSAP's timeline basics and am resonably proficient. It is frickin' cool. <br>

  <br />A dev-ops guy once advised me, "Concentrate on one thing. A small schema...just a couple of tables. Hook up those endpoints and hit them from the front-end. Keep it small." It was good advice.
  All my life I've been fighting this appetite to learn all the things vs focus on one thing... At this point, I have no time to speculate which approach is better.<br /><br>

  I just have to believe that cycling through, methodically, a list of tech--each, more or less--working in concert with the others--will deepen my grasp of each individually and the ecosystem as a whole. <br /><br />The joy in the immediate process is confirmed. So, with let's hope for exponential dividends.<br><br><code>var result*=;</code></h3>

    <h3 class="subtitle">Feel Great. Yesterday I tackled a minor js (fcc) problem.
    I got @import down in SCSS. Accomplished lots of styling problems in this app.
    Learned more about 'this' via jquery <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/x_Rh6qCmN5s?list=PLHJPCYLtEMaKdvFGcFk3ud-FEJv5j5dwR">tutorial</a>. Added a few new states to the app. Learned about a common problem I've had regarding running an animation upon completion of another. The answer is found in callbacks, or .delay(). Lots of good stuff.</h3>
