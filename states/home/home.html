<p class="dkgrey2">practical notes, code and advice distilled from myriad sources in web development. It is a "living-document" to which I contribute daily as a resource and reference to others.

<p class="dkgrey2">attribution of code and recommendations to useful articles, presentations, lectures, books, etc. will continue to be made as I iterate over these pages regularly.

<h5 class="dkgrey2">This is a fan-site for web developer/teachers. It's available here as a reference, a motivator and a way to give back something to the community that has been such a help to me in the past. <br /><br />If I am--at all--lucky enough to have helped just one person, then the months putting these pieces together will not have been misspent.</h5>
