# codejournal
This is a collection of notes & references that I am curating to study and to accelerate my build process. #[Kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen)ðŸ¤“
###### codejournal includes notes, examples & advice on the following:
### Journal
Daily journal entries in lieu of a "daily standup". What I did yesterday and what is on my todo list for today--identifying/anticipating potential painpoints. 

@End of the day (3am?-ish) --I revisit this and mark off what I've accomplished.
### Angularjs
Setup, implementation of Angulars awesomeness. Notes on scope inheritance, pitfalls of same... built-in & custom directives, filters, 3rd-parties
### Sass/CSS3
A basic soup-to-nuts build and SASS's fundamental features.
### ES6
A quick tour of ES6's core powers (as I come to learn them ðŸ˜Š & get comfortable using them)
### Javascript ("ecma" view)
from intermediate common uses through freqently used higher-order functions & DOM events in raw js. --Ajax, JSON normalization (that sort of thing).
### SVG
composition, implementation in brower and storage in postgresDB. (GSAP is pending).
### SQL
Basics and frequently used queries through a very tiny schema
--features a quick example of storing and retrieving an SVG file as a proof-of-concept.
### jQuery
Basic methods and notes on exercises I've worked through in lectures, etc.
Start Sass
sass --watch master.scss:master.css
### Node.js
A basic node setup using express, passport, cors, endpoints to query a postgresDB.
### Greensock (gsap)
Notes, walkthroughs & valuable snippets for getting started and continuing into gsap animations with SVG.
Will include embedded codepens as soon as I can figure those damned things out in Angularjs. #squadgoals
### Misc
These are simply a miscellany of notes & snippets.
